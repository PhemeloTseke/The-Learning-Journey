                    My name is Phemelo Tseke, aka Mel. My journey with Front-end development was an unconventional one. Before, the jump into web development, my focus was <span>set</span> on UI/UX Design, but I was quite unfulfilled with the idea of
                    just creating high fidelity prototypes. I needed the thrill of putting together the final product. Until this particular moment, all my learning related to Front-end development has been theoretical. Enrolling in <a href="https://zuri.team/"
                        target="_blank">The Zuri Internship Program</a> I am excited to practice my skills, learn from the wonderful Zuri team and grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not binge watching <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/the-amazing-world-of-gumball-c8b9c799-b81e-4522-a05b-40212f69e7a6" title="The Amazing World of Gumball" target="_blank">The Amazing World of Gumball</a> I'm reading and
                    practicing efficiency within my programming. I believe in the tech industry you are always learning as things evolve, and being a new-comer it helps familiarizing myself with both previous teachings and newer ones.

                <h2>Self-Taught? How?</h2>
                <p>
                    I am self-taught front-end developer who, before writing any code, watched a lot of tutorials to grasp concepts and learn how the languages I was learning are you used to programme. I started with learning HTML with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWv7vMbMWH4-V0ZXdmDpPBA"
                        target="_blank">Programming with Mosh</a>. Two month buried in theory I believe it's time to put my knowledge and skill to test. HTML was very enjoyable and really sets a stepping stone to being excited about programming in general.

                </p>

                <p>I later moved to CSS with
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA">Traversy Media</a> and fell in love <span>immediately with it</span>. Vanilla CSS is such a powerful tool which fascinates me greatly, which in turn makes me quite
                    excited to learning CSS frameworks and libraries in the future. I am a very artistic person (hence I initially gravitated towards design) so I immersed myself into CSS theory and I'm looking forward to learning advanced features.</p>
